# Phase 2 - Core Manufacturing Modules Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 2 implements the core manufacturing modules with proper RBAC, audit logging, and transactional operations. This includes Manufacturing Orders (MO), Work Orders (WO), Bill of Materials (BOM), Work Centers, and enhanced Stock Management.

## 🔧 Core Features Implemented

### 1. Manufacturing Orders (MO)
- ✅ Create MO with product, quantity, dates, assignee
- ✅ Confirm MO → Auto-generate Work Orders from BOM
- ✅ Status tracking: Planned → Confirmed → In Progress → Completed
- ✅ Role-based access (Manager/Admin can create/confirm)
- ✅ Audit logging for all MO operations

### 2. Work Orders (WO)
- ✅ Auto-generation from BOM operations during MO confirmation
- ✅ Start/Pause/Complete workflow with timestamps
- ✅ Operator can only manage assigned WOs
- ✅ Manager can override and reassign WOs
- ✅ Comments and issue tracking

### 3. Bill of Materials (BOM)
- ✅ Component definitions with quantities per unit
- ✅ Operation-based BOM (Assembly, Painting, etc.)
- ✅ Auto-scaling calculations based on MO quantity
- ✅ BOM retrieval for MO confirmation process

### 4. Work Centers
- ✅ Resource management (machines, teams, areas)
- ✅ Capacity tracking and utilization monitoring
- ✅ Active work order counts per center
- ✅ Cost per hour tracking

### 5. Enhanced Stock Management
- ✅ Real-time stock level monitoring
- ✅ Stock status indicators (Low, Out, Normal)
- ✅ Integration with MO/WO processes
- ✅ Stock adjustment capabilities

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, audit logs
- **Manager**: MO/WO management, BOM access, analytics
- **Operator**: Assigned WO execution only
- **Inventory**: Stock management, ledger access

### Audit Trail
- All manufacturing operations logged with user, timestamp, details
- Immutable audit log for compliance
- Role-based audit log access

### Transaction Safety
- Database transactions for multi-table operations
- Row-level locking for stock operations
- Rollback on errors to maintain data integrity

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Manufacturing Orders
```
POST   /api/mos                    # Create MO
GET    /api/mos                    # List MOs (with filters)
GET    /api/mos/:id                # Get MO details with WOs
POST   /api/mos/:id/confirm        # Confirm MO → Generate WOs
```

### Work Orders
```
GET    /api/wos                    # List WOs (role-filtered)
PUT    /api/wos/:id                # Update WO status
POST   /api/wos/:id/start          # Start WO (operator/manager)
POST   /api/wos/:id/complete       # Complete WO
```

### BOM & Resources
```
GET    /api/boms/:product_id       # Get BOM for product
GET    /api/work-centers            # List work centers
GET    /api/stock                  # Stock levels
```

### Analytics & Audit
```
GET    /api/analytics/dashboard    # Role-based analytics
GET    /api/audit-logs             # Audit trail (admin only)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Ensure PostgreSQL is running
# Database: manufacturing_db
# The schema will auto-initialize on server start
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start  # Runs on http://localhost:3001
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Demo Flow
```bash
# Run the Phase-2 demo script
node demo-phase2.js
```

## 🎮 Demo Scenario

The demo script demonstrates the complete Phase-2 workflow:

1. **Manager Login** - Authenticate as manager role
2. **Create MO** - Manufacturing Order for 5 wooden tables
3. **Check BOM** - Verify component requirements
4. **Confirm MO** - Auto-generate work orders from BOM
5. **View WOs** - See generated Assembly, Painting operations
6. **Execute WO** - Start and complete first work order
7. **Monitor Stock** - Check current inventory levels
8. **Analytics** - View production metrics
9. **Audit Trail** - Review all logged activities

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### MVP Requirements ✅
- [x] MO creation with proper validation
- [x] MO confirmation generates WOs from BOM
- [x] WO lifecycle (start → complete) updates MO progress
- [x] Role-based access enforced on UI and API
- [x] Audit logs for all manufacturing operations
- [x] Stock level monitoring and alerts
- [x] Analytics dashboard with role-specific data

### Integration Tests ✅
- [x] MO → WO → Stock flow works end-to-end
- [x] RBAC prevents unauthorized operations
- [x] Database transactions maintain consistency
- [x] Error handling with proper rollbacks

## 🔮 Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. **Stock Reservations** - Reserve components during MO confirmation
2. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket notifications for status changes
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Predictive insights and bottleneck detection
4. **Voice Control** - Operator voice commands for WO updates
5. **Mobile Optimization** - Touch-friendly operator interface

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Error**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
sudo service postgresql start
# Verify database exists
psql -U postgres -l
```

**API Authentication Error**
```bash
# Clear browser localStorage
localStorage.clear()
# Re-login with valid credentials
```

**Demo Script Fails**
```bash
# Ensure backend server is running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/products
# Check database has sample data
```

## 📈 Performance Notes

- Database indexes on frequently queried columns (status, dates)
- Pagination for large datasets (work orders, audit logs)
- Caching for static data (products, work centers)
- Transaction timeouts to prevent deadlocks

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Functional**: All CRUD operations work with proper validation
- **Security**: RBAC enforced, audit trail complete
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for typical operations
- **Reliability**: Zero data loss during error scenarios
- **Usability**: Intuitive UI for each user role
