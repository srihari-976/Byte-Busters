# Smart Manufacturing Management System

A comprehensive end-to-end manufacturing management application that enables businesses to create, track, and manage their production processes digitally. This system replaces fragmented spreadsheets and manual tracking with a centralized, user-friendly platform.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Manufacturing - From Order to Output, All in One Flow**

### Key Challenges Addressed:
1. **Fragmented Systems** - Manufacturing orders, stock management, and BOM tracking in separate tools
2. **Limited Visibility** - No real-time view of production stages and work order progress
3. **Manual Processes** - Paper-based BOMs, stock ledgers, and reports prone to errors
4. **Poor Integration** - Disconnected stock, production, and reporting systems
5. **No Dynamic Filtering** - Difficulty in quickly viewing order status and progress

## 👥 Target Users

### 1. Manufacturing Managers
- Oversee production orders and workflows
- Monitor overall production KPIs
- Generate reports and ensure traceability

### 2. Shop-floor Operators / Workers
- Execute assigned work orders
- Update status and progress
- Use voice commands for hands-free updates

### 3. Inventory Managers
- Track stock movement and raw material usage
- Monitor inventory levels and alerts
- Manage product master data

### 4. Business Owners / Admins
- Monitor overall production KPIs
- Generate comprehensive reports
- Manage user access and system configuration

## 📊 Sample Data & Use Cases

### Manufacturing Flow Example: Wooden Table Production

#### 1. **Product Definition**
```
Product: Wooden Table (1 Unit)
Components:
- 4 × Wood Legs
- 1 × Wood Top  
- 12 × Screws
- 0.5 ltr × Varnish

Operations:
- Assembly (60 mins) @ Assembly Line
- Painting (30 mins) @ Paint Booth  
- Packing (20 mins) @ Packaging Station
```

#### 2. **Manufacturing Order Creation**
- **MO001**: Produce 10 Wooden Tables
- **Auto-scaling**: System calculates 40 legs, 10 tops, 120 screws, 5 ltr varnish
- **Stock Check**: Validates component availability
- **Work Orders**: Auto-creates WO001 (Assembly), WO002 (Painting), WO003 (Packing)

#### 3. **Production Execution**
- **Operator** receives WO001 for Assembly
- **Voice Command**: "Start order WO001" 
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress tracked, timestamps recorded
- **Stock Consumption**: Raw materials automatically deducted
- **Completion**: "Complete order WO001" → triggers next work order

#### 4. **Stock Updates**
- **Raw Materials**: Automatically consumed based on BOM
- **Finished Goods**: Added to inventory upon MO completion
- **Ledger Entries**: Full audit trail maintained
