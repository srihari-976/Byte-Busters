## üöÄ Project Scope

**Core Modules (MVP):**
- Dashboard  
- Manufacturing Orders (MO)  
- Work Orders (WO)  
- Bills of Materials (BOM)  
- Stock Ledger  
- Reports  

**Innovation Layer:**
- AI predictive alerts  
- Voice-enabled updates

## üìë Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Preparation
- Define project scope  
- Assign roles  
- Set up tools (Odoo, PostgreSQL, React/Next.js, Python env, GitHub repo)  
- Communication tools: Slack/Discord + Google Drive  

### Phase 1: Authentication & Access
- Role-based dashboards (Manager, Operator, Inventory, Admin)  
- Secure login + OTP for password reset  

### Phase 2: Core Manufacturing Modules
- **Manufacturing Orders (MO):** CRUD, BOM linkage, status sync  
- **Bills of Materials (BOM):** Auto-scale components per product  
- **Work Orders (WO):** Track assembly, painting, packaging with Start/Pause/Complete actions  
- **Work Centers:** Track utilization, downtime, and costs  

### Phase 3: Stock Ledger & Product Master
- Real-time inventory sync after WO completion  
- Stock in/out system for raw and finished goods  

### Phase 4: Dashboard & Reporting
- Real-time MO list, KPIs, component availability  
- Analytics: throughput, delays, resource utilization  
- Export reports (Excel/PDF)  

### Phase 5: AI-Powered Predictive Alerts
- Train ML models (Isolation Forest, Random Forest, LSTM)  
- Predict delays & stock shortages  
- Risk highlighting & notifications  

### Phase 6: Voice-Enabled Shop Floor Updates
- Speech-to-text integration (Google Speech API / Vosk / Whisper)  
- Hands-free WO updates with natural commands  

### Phase 7: Scalability & Additional Modules
- Quality check, predictive maintenance, IoT integration  
- Notifications via email/SMS/push  

### Phase 8: Testing & Validation
- Unit, integration, and stress testing  
- User acceptance testing with factory workflow simulation  

### Phase 9: Demo & Presentation
- Story-driven demo (factory pain ‚Üí solution flow)  
- Highlight AI alerts + voice control  
- Reports & KPIs wrap-up
